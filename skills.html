            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>HTML is the language I use to create the structure and backbone of websites. I really enjoy learning how each HTML element has its own role and how combining them can create a clear and organized webpage. Even as a beginner, I try to make my HTML semantic, which means using the right tags for the right purpose, like header for the top of a page or section for different parts of content. HTML excites me because it's like building the skeleton of a website, and once the structure is there, I can use CSS and JavaScript to bring it to life.</p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS is what I use to make websites look beautiful, organized, and engaging. It lets me control the colors, fonts, spacing, and layout of a page, which means I can take a plain HTML page and turn it into something visually interesting and fun to use. I like experimenting with margins, padding, positioning, and alignment to make sure everything is neat and easy to read. I'm learning Flexbox and CSS Grid, which help me create layouts that look good on all devices, from phones to tablets to computers. I also enjoy trying animations, hover effects, and transitions, because they make the page feel interactive and alive.</p>

            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is the language I use to make websites interactive and dynamic. With JavaScript, I can create buttons that respond when clicked, simple forms that check if information is correct, sliders, pop-up messages, and even small games. I'm learning how to use loops, functions, and conditional statements to control how things happen on a page. I'm also exploring how to manipulate the DOM, which lets me change content or styles without reloading the page. JavaScript is really exciting because it allows me to bring my websites to life and make them more than just static pages.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>Python is the programming language I use to learn coding, solve problems, and create small projects. I can work with variables, loops, functions, and file handling, which lets me make simple programs like calculators, mini-games, and tools that automate repetitive tasks. I enjoy learning how Python helps me think logically and solve problems step by step, because it teaches me to plan and organize my code before writing it. Even as a beginner, I find it amazing when a program I write actually works and does exactly what I wantedâ€”it feels so satisfying! I also enjoy exploring Python libraries that let me do even more advanced things as I get better, like working with data, making simple applications, or experimenting with graphics.</p>
