            <h2>Get to know me</h2>
            <p>My name is <b>Oluwatunmininu</b>, but you can call me Tunmi for short. I am a 17 year old Nigerian currently living in the UK, <b>Wolverhampton</b> to be precise. I am from Ekiti state, and i'm Yoruba. My favourite sports are Badmitton and Basketball and my Favourite foods are Spaghetti, Jollof rice and Poundo an Egusi. My favourite colour is Dark red and my hobbies are cooking and trying out new artsy stuffs. I am currently studying Travel and Tourism in Sandwell college, West Bromwich.I am studying this because i want to be an Air Hostess. WHY?. I want to be an Air Hostess because, one thing about me is that i care about people a lot, i like being able to assist them in whatever way possible, beacuse it gives me joy, and me being an Air Hostess is all about that, being responsible, being passionate, being compassioante, being able to think fast and provide a solution in any situation or circumstance, and being able to provide help where needed. So in short, I want to be an Air Hostess, because it is basically everything about my personality and who i am as a person. Aside from all that, I'm also someone who loves meeting new people and learning about different cultures, which is another reason why being an air hostess feels perfect for me. I also believe that good communication and a positive attitude can go a long way, especially in a job that involves working closely with people every day. I'm very friendly and easy to talk to, and I always try to make others feel safe and comfortable around me. At the end of the day, I just want to do something meaningful something that allows me to help people, experience new things, and become the best version of myself. That's who I am, and that's what keeps me motivated every single day. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
